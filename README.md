# Mobile-App
This project is a basic clone of WhatsApp, called "Chatter," built using Jetpack Compose. The app currently implements the core functionality for text messaging. You can send and view messages, with a UI that mimics the look and feel of WhatsApp's chat interface and UI

## Features
* Chat Screen: You can send and receive text messages using a familiar chat interface.
* Sample Chat Data: The app demonstrates chat functionality with hardcoded sample data (e.g., name, message text, and timestamp).
* Text Input Area: A custom-designed bottom bar to type messages, with a floating action button for sending messages.
* Message Bubbles: Messages are displayed in alternating left-right alignment, similar to WhatsApp's chat design.

## File Overview
 * MainActivity.kt: Handles the user interface for the chat screen. It displays the list of chat messages and allows the user to input and send text messages. Media attachments and additional features will be added in the future.
