# Mobile-App
This project is a basic clone of WhatsApp, called "Chatter," built using Jetpack Compose. The app currently implements the core functionality for text messaging. You can send and view messages, with a UI that mimics the look and feel of WhatsApp's chat interface and UI

## Features
* Chat Screen: You can send and receive text messages using a familiar chat interface.
* Sample Chat Data: The app demonstrates chat functionality with hardcoded sample data (e.g., name, message text, and timestamp).
* Text Input Area: A custom-designed bottom bar to type messages, with a floating action button for sending messages.
* Message Bubbles: Messages are displayed in alternating left-right alignment, similar to WhatsApp's chat design.
